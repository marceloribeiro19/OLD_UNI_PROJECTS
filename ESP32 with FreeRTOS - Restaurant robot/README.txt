The robot is programmed using the C++ programming language and a Real-Time Operating System (FreeRTOS), utilizing multitasking and its associated features. Additionally, BnrOmni.h was employed to control the omnidirectional motion of the robot. The Arduino library, along with ESP32 WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, was also explored.

The robot is controlled by a mobile phone app created with 'MIT App Inventor,' allowing users to connect to the robot by bluetooth, select the desired table, stop the motion.

It's able to avoid obstacle colisions, it can be recharged wirlessly and as a circular led strip to indicate the user the current state(charging, turning left, turning right, obstacle detection, ready to return, etc.).
