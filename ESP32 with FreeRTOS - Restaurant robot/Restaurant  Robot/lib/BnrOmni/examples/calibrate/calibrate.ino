Omni-3MD 3 motor controller from botnroll.com http://www.botnroll.com/en/controllers/84-bot-n-roll-omni-3md-.html

Calibrate the Omni-3MD:
 - this code assumes you are using 1,2 or 3 DC motors with encoders attached to Omni3MD board;
 - this example was developed using Arduino 1.7.10 open-source Arduino environment
 - this example is compatible with Omni3MD firmware version 1.74 or higher. Visit http://www.botnroll.com/omni3md/ to check if your version is updated.

Purpose:
 This example explains the calibration routine and all necessary setup for the different types of movement.
 Calibrating for Omnidirectional (Holonomic) movement and Differential movement is not the same:
 In Omnidirectional movement calibration, all motors must make the robot rotate counter clockwise (CCW).
 For Differential movement calibration, motor1 and motor3 must make the robot move forward.
 The calibration command uses three parameters, one for each motor. 0 and 1 are the possible values for the parameters.
 0 makes the motor rotate in one direction (CW for example), and 1 makes the motor rotate the other way around (CCW).
 Each parameter defines the positve direction of the respective motor. Input the parameters according to your system.

 Omni3MD board features: 
 - Holonomic movement integrated control for 3 motors with PID control;
 - Diferencial movement (SI units) with PID control;
 - Linear movement of 3 independent motors with or without PID control;
 - Position control of 3 motors using motor encoders.
 - Encoder reading;
 - Battery reading;
 - Temperature reading;
 
 The circuit:
 * Omni3MD board attached to Arduino analog input 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL), GND and 5V DC.

  Important:
    For Omnidirectional movement calibration, all motors must make the robot rotate counter clockwise (CCW).
    For Differential movement calibration, motor1 and motor3 must make the robot move forward.
    Adjust the calibration routine parameters to acheive the necessary requirements for each type of calibration.
