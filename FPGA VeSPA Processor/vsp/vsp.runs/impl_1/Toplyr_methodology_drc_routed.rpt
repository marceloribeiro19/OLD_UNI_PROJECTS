TIMING-20#35 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch CPU/DP/aluInst/result_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin CPU/DP/aluInst/result_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#36 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch CPU/DP/aluInst/result_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin CPU/DP/aluInst/result_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 36 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
